# dss_text_prediction_app
This project was completed as part of the data science specialisation at Coursera.org. The code has been removed to to prevent its use in subsequent course submissions. The project consisted of creating a web app that implemented a natural language model to predict the next word in text input. 

The app can be viewed [here]((https://johnlee.shinyapps.io/capstone_shiny_app/)

The presentation on the underlying algorithm implemented can be viewed [here]([http://rpubs.com/timdanaos/test_prediction])
